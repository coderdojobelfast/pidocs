# Worksheets for the Python projects. 

These are the worksheets for the Python programs in the "pi" repository. The folder has the LibreOffice docs and exported PDFs for convenience.
  
There are a variety of worksheets in here - some for the electronics board, and some for Minecraft.  They started out in the form of a page or two of explanation followed by the complete code of the program. Each sheet tried to introduce another couple of programming concepts.

I found the kids ignored the boring wordy bits, and jumped straight to the code, blindly copying it to get it going.  To try to make them think a bit more, I created the 'Challenge' worksheets, where you're given the problem but not the solution.  The 'Solver' worksheets are in the same style but provide a bit more help, for the younger kids.

## Electronics Worksheets

- *led*  Simple flashing LED (blink.py).
- *press*  Add a Big Red Button to the previous program - the LED toggles on and off at the press of a button.
- *photoBooth*  Add the Pi Camera and create your own Photo Booth - press the button and the LED flashes, first slowly, then very quickly, then the camera takes your photo, and pops it up on a web page.  The web page is really simple (just uses meta http-equiv="refresh" to refresh) as the point of the exercise is the Python, not the HTML.

## Initial Minecraft Worksheets

- *teleport* Simple teleporter  (variables, while/if, import)
- *house*  Build a house (functions, simple input, a bit of maths (vector arithmetic!))
- *sword* A Magic Sword. Modules and event driven programming (pollBlockHits) - the magic sword is a module that will invoke whatever 'spell' - function - you pass into it whenever the Player uses the magic sword (right mouse button).
- *thread* Teleport + Magic Sword. Adds classes and multithreading. Use the magic sword to set the position to teleport to.

## The Challenges 
Challenges with little guidance. Some a bit tougher.

- *backtracker* Minecraft. Keep track of where you walk and then backtrack. Lists.
- *conveyor*  Minecraft. Build a moving walkway.
- *remote* Electronics. Use a remote control instead of the button in the Photo Booth.
- *thermo* Electronics. Build a digital thermometer from the DS18B20 temperature sensor and the 1602 LCD.

## The Problem Solvers

A bit simpler and with more help, based on the 'Yellow Brick Road'

- *yellow* Build a Yellow Brick Road
- *TNT* Build a TNT Brick Road.  Blow it up.
- *rainbow* Change the colours in the blocks as you go, to build a Rainbow Road.
